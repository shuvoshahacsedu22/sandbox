CS 456: ASSIGNMENT # 2
Shortest path alg'm
Via UDP
 
=======
 NOTES
=======

I used NBR_ROUTERS + 1 in arrays so that accessing was direct. I understand
this is not the most efficient, but I found it easier to code and read.

In my documentation I used the word ACK to mean when a router has sent
a HELLO message along a link and received a HELLO back along that 
same link.

NOTE: you will have to manually clean up the port because of no clean up
(see router.java for further information)

Files:
======
CircuitDB.java   - CircuitDB struct
HelloPkt.java    - HELLO struct
LinkCost.java    - LinkCost Struct
logger.java      - for log files
LSPDU.java       - LSPDU struct
router.java      - main functionality of this assignment
socket.java      - socket for sending/receiving packets

router.sh        - has file for starting up routers, in order, to run together


On host linux032: (ROUTERS)
NOTE: you may have to change the ports in this file in order to get it to work
    ./router.sh
